Render this scene in the style of impressionist masters, with bold, broken brushstrokes capturing the shimmering ocean and the splashes around the whale.

Un po' di dolore non può scalfire la mia passione, né può scalfire i miei sogni del domani, dove mi vedo in cima ad una montagna, una sentinella solitaria aspettando un meteorite, osservando silenziosamente le stelle danzare nella danza infinita dell'universo."
